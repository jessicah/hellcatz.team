<p><img id='zwift-kit' src='assets/images/hellcatz-kit.png'/><strong>Hellcatz</strong> is the ladies only sub-team of the <strong><a href='https://boltrace.team/'>Bolt Race Team</a></strong>.
  We&rsquo;re a passionate, supportive group of women with representation in all grades, A&mdash;D, and from all over the world. With the
  aid of Velocity Vixen and ZSUN, the Hellcatz created the wildly popular Wild Women Racing Series, which has seen over 200 women
  competing in our first &amp; second series.</p>

<p>Our team is built on the principles of passion, trust, courage, positivity and friendship.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re currently also looking for A grade women to join our team to help us in the upcoming Zwift Classics, racing against a number
  of pro continental teams! These will be running from mid June to early September, start times: 7pm AEST / 11am CEST / 10am BST / 5am EDT.
